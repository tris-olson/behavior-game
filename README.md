# behavior-game
My code for group project in computer games class at McGill. 
I implemented game logic, player movement, player-world interactions, and NPC behavior.

The game was intended to examine player interaction behavior, such as
- unnecessary violence
- interest in in-game gambling
- item collection
etc.

Files included here are just my code.
